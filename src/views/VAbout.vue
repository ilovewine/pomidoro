        <i>Pomodoro Technique</i>
        , originally invented by Francesco Cirillo in 1980, is a time management technique that consists of working in
        25-minute intervals separated by 5-minute breaks. One cycle, called
        <i>pomodoro</i>
        , consists of 4 work sessions and 1 break session which lasts for about half an hour.
      </p>
      
      <p>Before proceeding, make sure that:
      <ol>
        <li>you have set the goal you're about to work on (you can write them on list and set priorities in order to work on the most important things first)</li>
        <li>you have at least 90 minutes of spare time</li>
        <li>you can't be disturbed during your work (it includes your phone calls, notifications, emails, etc.)</li>
      </ol>
      </p>

      <p>Fun fact: Francesco did use a physical timer that looked like a tomato, hence the technique's name ðŸ˜‰</p>
